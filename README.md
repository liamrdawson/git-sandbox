# **Git Handbook**

Git is a fantastic tool but can sometimes be tough to work with. To help myself and others build on their confidence when using Git, and increase the awareness of tools that devs have available to work with I'm putting together this handbook. 

Git is a powerful tool that allows you to travers the timeline of your projects branches. This will hopefully demystify a lot of what Git is capable of and help you build a more solid foundation while picking up some new tricks along the way.
