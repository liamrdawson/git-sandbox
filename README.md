# **Git Handbook**

Git is a fantastic tool but can sometimes be tough to work with. To help myself and others build on their confidence when using Git, and increase the awareness of tools that devs have available to work with I'm putting together this handbook. 

This will hopefully demystify a lot of what Git is capable of and provide readers with a more solid foundation.

2. #### Starting Git
3. #### Managing History
4. #### Undoing
5. #### Rewriting History
6. #### The Git Object Model
7. #### Customize Git
