# **Get Confident with the Command Line**

If you want to manage your Git workflow efficiently and quickly, something that will really help you out will be to build up your confidence in the Command Line. It can be a daunting place if you're a beginner, but hopefully this chapter will get you up to speed on the tools you have available to you and how best you can use them.

## **ZSH and iTerm**
If you want to become effective in manipulating your git branches from the command line, then ZSH is something that can really help you here. With ZSH you can customise your command line environment so that useful information such as current location in the directory, or current branch, is readily available. This will give you a huge boost in command line confidence. Some resources on how to get started can be found here:

You can use custome ZSH themes like the one above to keep track of which branch you're on and whether or not it's dirty. This means that you can bounce around from branch to branch knowing that you're not at risk of losing any changes you've made. If you see that you're on a dirty branch, then it's probably best for you to stage and commit your changes before moving around.
