# **Get Confident with the Command Line**

If you want to manage your Git workflow efficiently and quickly, something that will really help you out will be to build up your confidence in the Command Line. It can be a daunting place if you're a beginner, but hopefully this chapter will get you up to speed on the tools you have available to you and how best you can use them.

### ZSH and iTerm
If you want to become effective in manipulating your git branches from the command line, then ZSH is your friend, and in particular a command line envitonment such as iTerm. Using ZSH with iTerm, you can customise your environment so that useful information such as current location in the directory, or current branch, is readily available. This will give you a huge boost in command line confidence. Some resources on how to get started can be found below:
