# **Managing History**

One of the most powerful features of Git is that it allows you to traverse the history of your project. With this in mind, one of the most valuable things that you can learn about Git is how to effectively travel through your projects timeline to find a specific change at a specific point in time. 

In this section we'll cover what you have available in Git to help you do just that.

## Enhance your Git log
You will be familiar with `git log` as the command that you run to give you a breakdown of your past commits leading up to where you are now. This contains information such as the Author, date and time, SHA of each commit.

Sometimes you might not want such a verbose description of each commit, you might only want the basic info of each commit to provide you with a quick overview. This is where you'd use `git log --oneline`. This will slim down the output of your log right down to an abbreviated SHA along with the commit message you provided with each commit on one line.
